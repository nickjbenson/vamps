##Abstract

NARX networks operate on time-domain signal windows and output feedback windows to mimic the dynamics of a given system. I implement and test these networks to evaluate their feasibility for solving motion planning problems for a generic 18-muscle appendage analog developed in simulation using Unity, with an emphasis on visualizing the training and path response data to understand the potential and limits of the system as a whole. Ultimately, results point to some real potential, as even overfitted networks are able to return useful decision-making data about potential future output states, and the system appears ripe for network optimization and architectural experimentation.
